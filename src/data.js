SO. I'm having an after party. Come one, come all, lets have a bonfire on the beach. It'll be mid summer and weather should be ace.

Bring your drugs, sex buddies and alcohol (and food of course)*, and we can chill on the beach to some Rock n' Roll.

And there were no speeches last time, and I think there should be speeches, so everyone must bring an embarrassing story about SOMEONE (you, me, a friend, your sex buddies) to share with the group at some point. 

I'll bring some snacks and a few cases of beer, but it'd be sweet if everyone could bring a little something to keep the good vibes rolling

Rules: 
1. You must come with some kind of Christmas costume otherwise you must donate alcoholic drinks to the house. 
2. I will try my hardest to make sure that Dinesh wears pants this year to save all of your poor eyes. 
3. If you decide to wrap yourself in shitty Big W tinsel which then gets left all over the house for us to CONTINUE TO FIND 8 MONTHS LATER, you won't be let in. 

Please check with us for plus ones, as our house is small and we are already pushing it with people :)`,
